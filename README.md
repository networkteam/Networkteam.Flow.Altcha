# ALTCHA Next-Gen Captcha for Flow framework

Integration of [ALTCHA](https://altcha.org/) Next-Gen Captcha in [Neos Flow](https://flowframework.readthedocs.io) applications. The package ships with a service class, which
wraps the code for creating a challenge with Altcha's php library [altcha-org/altcha-lib-php](https://github.com/altcha-org/altcha-lib-php)
and Flow validator for validating the captcha result.

Inspired by [NeosRulez.Neos.Form.AltchaCaptcha](https://github.com/patriceckhart/NeosRulez.Neos.Form.AltchaCaptcha)
